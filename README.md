Building a Graph

graph_properties: Test building a Graph object and checking its basic properties

shortest_unweighted: finding the shortest unweighted path from a given start node to a given end node using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

shortest_weighted: finding the shortest weighted path from a given start node to a given end node using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

connected_components: finding all connected components (subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other via some path) in the graph, but with a small catch: given some threshold thresh, you will be ignoring all edges with a weight larger than thresh. 

smallest_threshold: finding the smallest connecting threshold between a given pair of nodes u and v using Disjoint Sets
